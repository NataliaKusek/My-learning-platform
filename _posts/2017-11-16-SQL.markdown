# SQL

## SELECT 

_SELECT_ statement retrieves data from a single table.

```SELECT * FROM customer```

## ORDER BY

The _ORDER BY_ clause allows you to sort the rows returned from the SELECT statement in ascending or descending order based on the specified criteria.

```SELECT first_name, last_name FROM customer ORDER BY first_name ASC, last_name DESC```

## DISTINCT

If you specify multiple columns, the _DISTINCT_ clause will evaluate the duplicate based on the combination of values of these columns.

```SELECT DISTINCT bcolor FROM t1 ORDER BY bcolor```

PostgreSQL also provides the _DISTINCT ON_ (expression) to keep the “first” row of each group of duplicates.

```SELECT DISTINCT ON (bcolor) bcolor, fcolor FROM t1 ORDER BY bcolor, fcolor```

## WHERE

_WHERE_ are used to filter the rows returned from the SELECT statement.
